Various scripts for automatic simple data preprocessing in EEGlab for multiple participants
*** NOTE: All scripts are created for a particular experiment, but can be extended later. These are work files which are, in most cases, working only for a specified datasets. More comments and further explanation will be given soon. ***

EEGLab_Average_Reference.m
- Creates new dataset with changed reference to AVG reference for all participants data stored in ALLEEG structure

EEGLab_Resampling.m
- Creates new dataset with changed sampling rate for all participants data stored in ALLEEG structure

EEGLab_Events_Epochs_Various_Scripts.m
- [1] Creates new dataset with chosen events for all participants data stored in ALLEEG structure
- [2] Makes epochs based on chosen event for all participants data stored in ALLEEG structure
- [3] Epoch-2-continious data
- [4] Removes boundary events
